<p>Implements a <a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/api/1.5/org/apache/jackrabbit/core/query/AbstractQueryHandler.html" target="_blank">Jackrabbit query handler</a> using
XTF and other query handling classes.</p>

<p>Both the XPath and SQL queries are translated by the Jackrabbit core 
to the Abstract Query Tree (AQT), the common query description format 
that allows Jackrabbit to implement a query engine which is (to a 
certain extent) independent of the query syntax used (XPath or SQL). 
The <a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/search-implementation.html">
"Search Implementation" section of the Jackrabbit website</a> details the 
implementation of searches in Jackrabbit along with the default search 
index being used.</p>

<p>The search index in Jackrabbit is pluggable and has a default 
implementation based on Apache Lucene. The default implementation is 
independent of the persistence manager being used. To connect to an
existing XTF repository, a new search index manager needs to be written to
interpret the AQT and generate <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/xtf/wiki/tagRef_crossQuery_QueryParser_Output" target="_blank">raw XML query</a>
statements that can be executed
against the raw servlet of the XTF repository.
