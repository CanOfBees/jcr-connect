Implements a Java XTF client that takes a search phrase and returns
a list of XTF documents.

<ul>
<li>Method

<p>In current implementation the JCR adapter for XTF is a Jackrabbit index 
manager that implements the 
<a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/api/1.5/org/apache/jackrabbit/core/query/AbstractQueryHandler.html" target="_blank">org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.AbstractQueryHandler</a> 
interface. It translates all JCR queries to XTF queries and stores all 
the items returned in a Jackrabbit repository. All future node/property 
storing and loading requests are then directed to this Jackrabbit 
repository.

<p>This implementation is actually not a real "connector" since read/write 
requests are not directed to the underlying XTF repository, instead, 
they are addressed by a Jackrabbit repository which serves as a proxy. 
The Jackrabbit repository is populated by JCR search requests such that 
only those items that the client is interested in will be pulled out of 
XTF repository and stored in the Jackrabbit repository.

<li>Mapping

<p>Each XTF item or collection is mapped to a JCR node in the Jackrabbit
  repository.

<p>The "path" attribute of the "docHit" element in the XTF query results will
  be used as the JCR path for the corresponding JCR node in the Jackrabbit
  repository. The "recordNum" attribute will also be attached if it is present.

<p>The elements under "meta" tag in the XTF query results, particular those
  Dublin Core metadata elements, will be stored in the Jackrabbit repository
  as properties of the corresponding JCR node for easy search.

<li>Miscellaneous

<p>The "identifier" tag in the query results, if present, will contain an
  HTTP link that points to the METS file describing the item/collection or to
  the actual resource. If it contains a METS file link, the METS file will be
  retrieved and parsed to fetch the file location of the underlying resources
  (images, texts, etc.). To get the proper link to the METS file, the server
  URL needs to be attached. For example, if "identifier" contains

<p>http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt6n39n8g8

<p>the URL of the METS file will be (the trailing "/" is required)

<p>http://content.cdlib.org/mets/ark:/13030/kt6n39n8g8/

<p>VTD-XML is used as a light-weigh parser to parse XML files
(XTF query results and METS files).

<p>For the CDLib instance on which the XTF connector is built:

<p>Only items in oac.cdlib.org have oac4-tab values (EAD+TEI+images+MARC);
Only items in calisphere.org have facet-type-tab values (TEI+images+websites)

<p>The vocabulary for "facet-type-tab" is

<ul>
<li>website
<li>image
<li>text
</ul>

<p>The vocabulary for "oac4-tab" is

<ul>
<li>Collections::ead
<li>Collections::marc
<li>Items::image
<li>Items::offline (MARC item level records of archival materials)
<li>Items::text
</ul>

<p>Websites would not have an "oac4-tab". Collections::* and Items::offline
would not have a "facet-type-tab".
  
</ul>
