<p>Implements the persistence interface for Fedora repositories in order
to leverage existing Apache Jackrabbit code for the JCR adapter.

<p>In current implementation the JCR adapter for Fedora is a Jackrabbit 
persistence manager that implements the 
<a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/api/1.5/org/apache/jackrabbit/core/persistence/PersistenceManager.html">org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.PersistenceManager</a> interface. 
It translates all node/property storing and loading requests to API calls 
(REST or API-A/API-M) made to the underlying Fedora repository.</p>

There are pros and cons of this implementation:
<p>Pros<br>
This implementation allowed a rapid development of the JCR connector for 
Fedora, reusing the majority of existing Jackrabbit code. If correctly 
implemented, it should work with any other software that currently 
connects to Jackrabbit, for example, Apache Sling.</p>

<p>Cons<br>
A persistence manager in Jackrabbit is designed to transmit data between 
memory space and persistent storage (disk file, database, etc.) and is not 
supposed to be "smart" in the sense of interpreting data. The Fedora 
persistence manager, however, will need to interpret objects hierarchy 
in a Fedora repository and artificially create data structure 
(parent-child relationships in the JCR tree, fictional root node, etc.) 
in order to appear like a normal persistence manager. This might lead to 
a difficult implementation.</p>

<p> For a detailed document on persistence manager configuration
in Jackrabbit, please refer to <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/jackrabbit/PersistenceManagerFAQ">Persistence Manager (PM) FAQ on the Jackrabbit Wiki</a>.

<p> Also defined in this package is the Fedora connector classes
that wrap API-A/API-M or REST API calls to the underlying repository
that perform different reading and writing tasks.
