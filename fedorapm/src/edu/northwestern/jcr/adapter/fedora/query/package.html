<p>Implements a <a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/api/1.5/org/apache/jackrabbit/core/query/AbstractQueryHandler.html">Jackrabbit query handler</a> using
Fedora and other query handling classes.</p>

<p>Both the XPath and SQL queries are translated by the Jackrabbit core 
to the Abstract Query Tree (AQT), the common query description format 
that allows Jackrabbit to implement a query engine which is (to a 
certain extent) independent of the query syntax used (XPath or SQL). 
The <a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/search-implementation.html">
"Search Implementation" section of the Jackrabbit website</a> details the 
implementation of searches in Jackrabbit along with the default search 
index being used.</p>

<p>The search index in Jackrabbit is pluggable and has a default 
implementation based on Apache Lucene. The default implementation is 
independent of the persistence manager being used. To connect to an 
existing Fedora repository, a new search index manager is written to
interpret the AQT and generate SPARQL statements that can be executed 
against the Mulgara-backed resource index of the Fedora repository.</p>
